|        |Prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they           will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. Your report will be considered when building a credit score for a           potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.|
|.       |You're an analyst at Crankshaft List. Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on your site every day. You need to study data collected           over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.|
|        |You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department             wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. 
          You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients:           who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to                analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.|
