|        |Prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they           will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. Your report will be considered when building a credit score for a           potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.|
|        |You're an analyst at Crankshaft List. Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on your site every day. You need to study data collected           over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.|
|        |You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department             wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of             the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan           they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan           brings in more revenue.|
|        |You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and           historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will               allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016           and you’re planning a campaign for 2017. (The important thing is to get experience working with data. It doesn't really matter whether you're forecasting           2017 sales based on data from 2016 or 2017 sales based on data from 2016.) The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating             Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.|
|        |You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available                       information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Working with a database, you'll analyze data from             competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.|
